Log in and start terminal session

Can’t use dd (per Ione’s suggestion) because no hash option; have to use dcfldd

sudo mkdir /forensicimages

Find thumb drive
1. sudo fdisk -l
2. shows /dev/sda with /dev/sda1 and
      /dev/sdb with /dev/sdb1, /dev/sdb2 and /dev/sdb5
3. mount | grep sd
      shows /dev/sdb1 mounted on / ==>> /dev/sda is thumb drive

check if dcfldd exists on system
       sudo: dcfldd: command not found

get dcfldd
1. sudo apt install dcfldd
       404  Not Found
2. sudo apt-get update
3. dcfldd
       Command 'dcfldd' not found, but can be installed with:
       sudo apt install dcfldd
       Do you want to install it? (N/y)
answer "y"

dcfldd options:

  if - use named input file
  of - writes to named file
  hash - set hash format
  hashlog send hash output to file
  vf – verify file

run cmd "sudo dcfldd if=/dev/sda of=/forensicimages/forensicimage.dd hash=sha512 hashlog=/forensicimages/forensicimage.txt"
       to create image file

run cmd "sudo dcfldd if=/dev/sda vf=/forensicimages/forensicimage.dd verifylog=/forensicimages/forensicimage.txt"
       to validate; result "Total: Match"
