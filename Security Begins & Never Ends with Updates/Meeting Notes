@playerone, was going to have you create some accounts on the backup server for me but based on the security audit I just got we clearly have more
important things to do.

Thanh Akasaka @takasaka
@gbates, I don't believe that the backup server's FTP service has been updated in a long time. To make matters worse it looks like the FTP package
we are using on the version it is at has a serious vunerability in it!

Richard LeGrand @rlegrand
THE WEBSITE IS DOWN!

Gilly Bates @gbates
Richard, what are you talking about? You should be able to access the site at joomla.daswebs.com.

Thanh Akasaka @takasaka
The website is in fact running but it is another sore spot on this security audit. The CMS (Joomla) it is running on is also very outdated...

Gilly Bates @gbates
Really? Well, if that's the case, @playerone, those backup accounts really are out of the question now. You need to get those services updated as soon
as possible. Do not go and change them to different packages or applications though, we picked those ones for a reason.

Ione Leventis @ileventis
Holy tacos! @everyone did you see this third line in the security audit?? Guests able to login and have admin privileges on Active Directory (Domain-controller)
 administered systems!?!? How does that even happen!?

Gilly Bates @gbates
Oh wow. We never got around to fixing that issue... The last systems admin that worked on it was fired because of that. @playerone, I know you're already
busy but you will need to set the AD guest user to the correct permission set. AKA no domain admin privileges.

Gary Thatcher @gthatcher
Can't believe that old admin played it off as a fake virus attack. That's the oldest trick in the book. Truely classic.

Richard LeGrand @rlegrand
VIRUS!!!! WE HAVE A VIRUS!!!!

Gilly Bates @gbates
Oh no. He's at it again. He's probably out in the halls already causing pandemonium. @playerone, get onto the prod-web server and Backup to update
the CMS and FTP service, and also fix those permissions on the AD guest user. Get this done ASAP!!!
