I initially tried to scan the drive with Defender, but it kept telling me that the scan was interrupted.

From Windows PowerShell in admin mode I tried "Start-MpScan -ScanPath e: -ScanType FullScan" but for some reason I got no results

So I downloaded and installed Malwarebytes

I opened File Explorer and right-clicked e:, selecting "Scan with Malwarebytes" which gave me the following files:

E:\SCHOOL\IST25\VALENTINESDAY.PTT.VSX

E:\TUX\EXTMENU.CFG

E:\WORK\HRWORK_FILES\PERMANTENT.TMP

E:\THUMB.INI

as EICAR-AV-Test Malware

I quarantined these, then instructed Malwarebytes to delete them permanently.

Lastly, I uninstalled Malwarebytes.
