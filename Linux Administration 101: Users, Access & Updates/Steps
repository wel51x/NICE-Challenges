Log in as playerone

Issue “sudo useradd gthatcher” cmd, since name must be “First initial and last name”

Issue "sudo passwd gthatcher" to give password as password123 (otherwise won't be able to login)

Wanted to add to sudo group, but “groups” cmd shows only playerone and wheel

Issue “sudo usermod -aG wheel gthatcher” cmd since wheel group gives sudo privilege

Since OS is CentOS, have to use yum to apply updates

Issue “sudo yum update” command (brute-force all updates - runs a while)
